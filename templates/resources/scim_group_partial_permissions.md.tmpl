~> This resource is designed for **federated permission management** where multiple teams manage different permissions for the same externally-managed group (e.g., SCIM groups).

## Use Case Guidelines

Choose the right resource for your use case:

| Resource | Group Creation | Permission Management | Use When |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| `dbtcloud_group` | ✅ Terraform creates | Full (replaces all) | Single Terraform workspace manages everything |
| `dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions` | ✅ Terraform creates | Partial (adds/removes) | Multiple workspaces manage same Terraform-created group |
| `dbtcloud_scim_group_permissions` | ❌ External (SCIM) | Full (replaces all) | External group, single workspace manages all permissions |
| `dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions` | ❌ External (SCIM) | Partial (adds/removes) | External group, multiple workspaces manage different permissions |

## Federated Permission Management Pattern

This resource enables the following pattern:

```hcl
# Platform team manages base permissions (workspace 1)
data "dbtcloud_groups" "data_platform" {
  name = "data-platform-team"
}

resource "dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions" "platform_base" {
  group_id = data.dbtcloud_groups.data_platform.groups[0].id
  
  permissions = [
    {
      permission_set = "member"
      all_projects   = true
    }
  ]
}

# Analytics team manages their project permissions (workspace 2)
data "dbtcloud_groups" "data_platform" {
  name = "data-platform-team"
}

data "dbtcloud_project" "analytics" {
  name = "Analytics"
}

resource "dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions" "analytics_team" {
  group_id = data.dbtcloud_groups.data_platform.groups[0].id
  
  permissions = [
    {
      permission_set = "developer"
      project_id     = data.dbtcloud_project.analytics.id
      all_projects   = false
      writable_environment_categories = ["development", "staging"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Both resources manage different permissions for the same group without conflicts.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

~> **Import Not Supported:** This resource does not support `terraform import` because it manages only a partial subset of permissions. 
There is no way for Terraform to know which specific permissions this resource instance should manage versus permissions 
managed by other resources or applied outside of Terraform. You must define the resource in your configuration from the start.

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

~> In October 2023, CI improvements have been rolled out to dbt Cloud with minor impacts to some jobs:  [more info](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/release-notes/june-2023/ci-updates-phase1-rn). 
<br/>
<br/>
Those improvements include modifications to deferral which was historically set at the job level and will now be set at the environment level. 
Deferral can still be set to "self" by setting `self_deferring` to `true` but with the new approach, deferral to other runs need to be done with `deferring_environment_id` instead of `deferring_job_id`.

~> New with 0.3.1, `triggers` now accepts a `on_merge` value to trigger jobs when code is merged in git. If `on_merge` is `true` all other triggers need to be `false`.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, it is not a mandatory field, but it will be in a future version. Please add `on_merge` in your config or modules.

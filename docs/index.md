# dbtcloud Provider

~> ðŸš§ IMPORTANT! ðŸš§  
Since 0.3, only resources starting with `dbtcloud_xxx` are allowed. If you use the legacy `dbt_cloud_xxx` ones, you will have to stay on 0.2.x or move to the new resources.
Instruction on how to do it is available in the 0.2.x docs.



## Provider configuration

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dbtcloud = {
      source  = "dbt-labs/dbtcloud"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "dbtcloud" {
  account_id = var.dbt_cloud_account_id
  token      = var.dbt_cloud_token
  host_url   = "https://cloud.getdbt.com/api"
}
```

# dbtcloud_environment (Data Source)

Retrieve data for a single environment



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (Number) The ID of the environment
- `project_id` (Number) The project ID to which the environment belongs

### Read-Only

- `connection_id` (Number) The ID of the connection to use (can be the `id` of a `dbtcloud_global_connection` or the `connection_id` of a legacy connection). At the moment, it is optional and the environment will use the connection set in `dbtcloud_project_connection` if `connection_id` is not set in this resource. In future versions this field will become required, so it is recommended to set it from now on. When configuring this field, it needs to be configured for all the environments of the project. To avoid Terraform state issues, when using this field, the `dbtcloud_project_connection` resource should be removed from the project or you need to make sure that the `connection_id` is the same in `dbtcloud_project_connection` and in the `connection_id` of the Development environment of the project
- `credentials_id` (Number) Credential ID for this environment. A credential is not required for development environments, as dbt Cloud defaults to the user's credentials, but deployment environments will have this.
- `custom_branch` (String) The custom branch name to use
- `dbt_version` (String) Version number of dbt to use in this environment.
- `deployment_type` (String) The type of deployment environment (currently 'production', 'staging' or empty)
- `enable_model_query_history` (Boolean) Whether model query history is on
- `extended_attributes_id` (Number) The ID of the extended attributes applied
- `name` (String) The name of the environment
- `type` (String) The type of environment (must be either development or deployment)
- `use_custom_branch` (Boolean) Whether to use a custom git branch in this environment

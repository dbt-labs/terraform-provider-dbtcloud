# dbtcloud_groups (Data Source)

Retrieve all groups in the account with optional filtering. This data source can be used to retrieve a list of groups for use in other resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get all active groups (using string)
data "dbtcloud_groups" "active_groups_string" {
  state = "active"
}

# Get all active groups (using integer as string)
data "dbtcloud_groups" "active_groups_int" {
  state = "1"
}

# Get deleted groups
data "dbtcloud_groups" "deleted_groups" {
  state = "deleted"  # or state = "2"
}

# Get all groups regardless of state
data "dbtcloud_groups" "all_groups" {
  state = "all"
}

# Get groups with names containing "dev"
data "dbtcloud_groups" "dev_groups" {
  name_contains = "dev"
  state = "active"
}

# Get a specific group by exact name
data "dbtcloud_groups" "specific_group" {
  name = "Developers"
}

# Filter SCIM managed groups
locals {
  scim_groups = [
    for group in data.dbtcloud_groups.all_groups.groups : group 
    if group.scim_managed == true
  ]
  
  manual_groups = [
    for group in data.dbtcloud_groups.all_groups.groups : group 
    if group.scim_managed == false
  ]
}

# Access groups by name in other resources
resource "dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions" "example" {
  group_id = [for group in data.dbtcloud_groups.all_groups.groups : group.id if group.name == "Developers"][0]
  # ... other configuration
}

# Create a local map of group names to IDs
locals {
  group_map = {
    for group in data.dbtcloud_groups.all_groups.groups : group.name => group.id
  }
}
```

# dbtcloud_jobs (Data Source)

Retrieve all the jobs for a given dbt Cloud project or environment along with the environment details for the jobs. This will return both the jobs created from Terraform but also the jobs created in the dbt Cloud UI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// we can search all jobs by project
data dbtcloud_jobs test_all_jobs_in_project {
  project_id = 1234
}

// or by environment
data dbtcloud_jobs test_all_jobs_in_environment {
  environment_id = 1234
}

// we can then retrieve all the jobs from the environment flagged as production
// this would include the jobs created by Terraform and the jobs created from the dbt Cloud UI
locals {
  my_jobs_prod = [for job in data.dbtcloud_jobs.test_all_jobs_in_project.jobs : job if job.environment.deployment_type == "production"]
}
```

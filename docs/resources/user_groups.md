# dbtcloud_user_groups (Resource)


Assigns a set of dbt Cloud groups to a given User ID. 

~> If additional groups were assigned manually in dbt Cloud, they will be removed. The full list of groups need to be provided as config.
		
~> This resource does not currently support deletion (e.g. a deleted resource will stay as-is in dbt Cloud).
This is intentional in order to prevent accidental deletion of all users groups assigned to a user.
If you would like a different behavior, please open an issue on GitHub. To remove all groups for a user, set "group_ids" to the empty set "[]".

## Example Usage

```terraform
// we can assign groups to users
resource "dbtcloud_user_groups" "my_user_groups" {
  user_id = data.dbtcloud_user.my_user.id
  group_ids = [
    // the group_id can be written directly
    1234,
    // or we can refer to a group created by Terraform
    dbtcloud_group.my_group.id,
    // or we can use  a local variable (see the guide on how to use the HTTP provider)
    local.my_group_id,
  ]
}

// as Delete is not handled currently, by design, removing all groups from a user can be done with
resource "dbtcloud_user_groups" "my_other_user_groups" {
  user_id   = 123456
  group_ids = []
}
```

- `project_id` (Number) Project ID to create the connection in
- `server` (String) The server hostname.

### Optional

- `login_timeout` (Number) The number of seconds used to establish a connection before failing. Defaults to 0, which means that the timeout is disabled or uses the default system settings.

import {
  to = dbtcloud_fabric_connection.my_connection
  id = "project_id:connection_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_fabric_connection.my_connection
  id = "12345:6789"
}

# using the older import command

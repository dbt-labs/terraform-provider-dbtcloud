## Example Usage

```terraform
# when using sql authentication
resource "dbtcloud_synapse_credential" "my_synapse_cred_sql" {
  project_id           = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  authentication       = "sql"
  schema               = "my_schema"
  user                 = "my_user"

}

# when using AD authentication
resource "dbtcloud_synapse_credential" "my_synapse_cred_ad" {

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# using  import blocks (requires Terraform >= 1.5)
import {
  to = dbtcloud_synapse_credential.my_synapse_credential
  id = "project_id:credential_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_synapse_credential.my_synapse_credential
  id = "12345:6789"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_synapse_credential.my_synapse_credential "project_id:credential_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_synapse_credential.my_synapse_credential 12345:6789
```

# dbtcloud_environment (Resource)


Resource to manage dbt Cloud environments for the different dbt Cloud projects. In a given dbt Cloud project, one development environment can be defined and as many deployment environments as needed can be created. ~> In August 2024, dbt Cloud released the "global connection" feature, allowing connections to be defined at the account level and reused across environments and projects. This version of the provider has the connection_id as an optional field but it is recommended to start setting it up in your projects. In future versions, this field will become mandatory.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "ci_environment" {
  // the dbt_version is major.minor.0-latest , major.minor.0-pre or latest (by default, it is set to latest if not configured)
  dbt_version   = "latest"
  name          = "CI"
  project_id    = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type          = "deployment"
  credential_id = dbtcloud_snowflake_credential.ci_credential.credential_id
  connection_id = dbtcloud_global_connection.my_global_connection.id
}

// we can also set a deployment environment as being the production one
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "prod_environment" {
  dbt_version     = "1.7.0-latest"
  name            = "Prod"
  project_id      = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type            = "deployment"
  credential_id   = dbtcloud_snowflake_credential.prod_credential.credential_id
  deployment_type = "production"
  connection_id   = dbtcloud_connection.my_legacy_connection.connection_id
}

// Creating a development environment
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "dev_environment" {
  dbt_version = "latest"
  name        = "Dev"
  project_id  = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type        = "development"
  connection_id = dbtcloud_global_connection.my_other_global_connection.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the environment
- `project_id` (Number) Project ID to create the environment in
- `type` (String) The type of environment (must be either development or deployment)

### Optional

- `connection_id` (Number) A connection ID (used with Global Connections)
- `credential_id` (Number) The project ID to which the environment belongs.
- `custom_branch` (String) The custom branch name to use
- `dbt_version` (String) Version number of dbt to use in this environment. It needs to be in the format `major.minor.0-latest` (e.g. `1.5.0-latest`), `major.minor.0-pre`, `versionless`, or `latest`. While `versionless` is still supported, using `latest` is recommended. Defaults to `latest` if no version is provided
- `deployment_type` (String) The type of environment. Only valid for environments of type 'deployment' and for now can only be 'production', 'staging' or left empty for generic environments
- `enable_model_query_history` (Boolean) Whether to enable model query history in this environment. As of Oct 2024, works only for Snowflake and BigQuery.
- `extended_attributes_id` (Number) The ID of the extended attributes applied
- `is_active` (Boolean) Whether the environment is active
- `use_custom_branch` (Boolean) Whether to use a custom git branch in this environment

### Read-Only

- `environment_id` (Number) The ID of the environment. Duplicated. Here for backward compatibility.
- `id` (String) The ID of environment.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# using  import blocks (requires Terraform >= 1.5)
import {
  to = dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment
  id = "project_id:environment_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment
  id = "12345:6789"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment "project_id:environment_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment 12345:6789
```

# dbtcloud_environment (Resource)


Retrieve data for a single environment

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "ci_environment" {
  // the dbt_version is major.minor.0-latest , major.minor.0-pre or latest (by default, it is set to latest if not configured)
  dbt_version   = "latest"
  name          = "CI"
  project_id    = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type          = "deployment"
  credential_id = dbtcloud_snowflake_credential.ci_credential.credential_id
  connection_id = dbtcloud_global_connection.my_global_connection.id
}

// we can also set a deployment environment as being the production one
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "prod_environment" {
  dbt_version     = "1.7.0-latest"
  name            = "Prod"
  project_id      = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type            = "deployment"
  credential_id   = dbtcloud_snowflake_credential.prod_credential.credential_id
  deployment_type = "production"
  connection_id   = dbtcloud_connection.my_legacy_connection.connection_id
}

// Creating a development environment
resource "dbtcloud_environment" "dev_environment" {
  dbt_version = "latest"
  name        = "Dev"
  project_id  = dbtcloud_project.dbt_project.id
  type        = "development"
  connection_id = dbtcloud_global_connection.my_other_global_connection.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the environment
- `project_id` (Number) (Number) Project ID to create the environment in
- `type` (String) (String) The type of environment (must be either development or deployment)

### Optional

- `credential_id` (Number) The project ID to which the environment belong
- `custom_branch` (String) The custom branch name to use
- `dbt_version` (String) (String) Version number of dbt to use in this environment. It needs to be in the format `major.minor.0-latest` (e.g. `1.5.0-latest`), `major.minor.0-pre`, `versionless`, or `latest`. While `versionless` is still supported, using `latest` is recommended. Defaults to `latest` if no version is provided
- `deployment_type` (String) (String) The type of environment. Only valid for environments of type 'deployment' and for now can only be 'production', 'staging' or left empty for generic environments
- `enable_model_query_history` (Boolean) (Boolean) Whether to enable model query history in this environment. As of Oct 2024, works only for Snowflake and BigQuery.

### Read-Only

- `environment_id` (Number) The ID of the environment
- `id` (String) The ID of the license map

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# using  import blocks (requires Terraform >= 1.5)
import {
  to = dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment
  id = "project_id:environment_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment
  id = "12345:6789"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment "project_id:environment_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_environment.prod_environment 12345:6789
```

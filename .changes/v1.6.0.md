# [v1.6.0](https://github.com/dbt-labs/terraform-provider-dbtcloud/compare/v1.5.2...v1.6.0)
### Changes
* Fixed timout_seconds missing field
* Added support for catalog_ingestion, explorer_account_ui, fusion_migration_permissions and cost_insights
* Added snowflake and databricks platform metadata credentials
* Added support for catalog configs
### Fixes
* Fix multiline for execute steps
* Handle resource removal from state if resource not found
* Fix permission duplication in `dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions` and `dbtcloud_group_partial_permissions` resources. Permissions could duplicate exponentially when multiple resources manage the same group or during repeated create/destroy cycles. The fix prevents new duplicates and automatically cleans up existing ones.
### Behind the scenes
* Re-enable skipped tests

# [v1.4.0](https://github.com/dbt-labs/terraform-provider-dbtcloud/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0)
### Changes
* Add new `dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions` resource for federated permission management.
This resource enables multiple Terraform workspaces to manage different permissions for the same
externally-managed group (e.g., SCIM-synced groups). Platform teams can manage base permissions
while individual teams manage project-specific permissions independently.

* Validation for athena s3 path
* Add spark credential
* Add force_node_selection for SAO
* Added new `dbtcloud_spark_credential` resource and data source for managing Apache Spark credentials.
This enables users to create and manage Apache Spark credentials separately from Databricks credentials,
providing proper support for Apache Spark connections with the correct adapter version (apache_spark_v0).

### Fixes
* Fixed panic crash when attempting to move jobs to environments with insufficient permissions. 
Added nil pointer checks in job creation, enhanced API error handling for 401/403/404 permission errors,
and improved error messages to show attempted changes with environment-specific guidance.
Fixed DELETE 404 handling to treat already-deleted resources as success.

### Behind the scenes
* Fixes to E2E tests
* Test job for issue 516
### Documentation
* Improved CredentialID description on Environment resource

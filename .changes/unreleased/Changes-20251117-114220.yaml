  Added new `dbtcloud_spark_credential` resource and data source for managing Apache Spark credentials.
  This enables users to create and manage Apache Spark credentials separately from Databricks credentials,
  providing proper support for Apache Spark connections with the correct adapter version (apache_spark_v0).

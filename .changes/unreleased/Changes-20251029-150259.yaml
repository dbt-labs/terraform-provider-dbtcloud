  Add new `dbtcloud_scim_group_partial_permissions` resource for federated permission management.
  This resource enables multiple Terraform workspaces to manage different permissions for the same
  externally-managed group (e.g., SCIM-synced groups). Platform teams can manage base permissions
  while individual teams manage project-specific permissions independently.
